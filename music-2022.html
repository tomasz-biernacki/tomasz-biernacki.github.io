    <p>15. The National - Bloodbuzz Ohio (2010)<br/>The instantly-recognisable drum intro and baritone vocals make this a true classic. Great emotional release at the end of the song.</p>

    <p>14. Militarie Gun - Big Disappointment (2021)<br />This one just stuck in my head. A more approachable entry from this band, with enjoyable lyrics.</p>

    <p>13. Himiko Kikuchi - Look Your Back (1987)<br />Funk entry. The incredibly catchy bass here is the star to me but tbh it's funk all around.</p>

    <p>12. Of Monsters And Men - Six Weeks (2012)<br />Melodic [pop|folk]-rock entry. Something about the epic singing and arrangements that tele-transports me to another universe.</p>

    <p>11. Husker Du - Plans I Make (1985)<br />Behind a furious wall of sound, the voice of an overly-active mind is screaming in desperation ("Make... plans! Make... plans!"), just to end up totally exhausted at the end (3:20). Hardcore, raw to the bone.</p>

    <p>10. Mannarino - Statte Zitta (2011)<br />One of my favorite Italian songs, to listen to and sing (admittedly, very poorly). A story of love, of a tough guy wonders why he's fallen in love.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UaA0VUE89QU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>09. CCCP - Emilia Paranoica (Remiscelata) (1986)<br />A claustrophobic rhythmic section serves as the foundation to a pretty disturbing trip. Dark but beautiful lyrics ("Aspetto un'emozione sempre pi√π indefinibile" / "I await an increasingly indefinable emotion").</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bt-Bru9aC8M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>08. Daitarn III (1980)<br />Italian opening of the animated cartoon. Sick bass line and incredibly contagious chorus (0:46). Childhood memories.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8wMlJHuudWQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>07. Bruce Springsteen - Dancing in the dark (1984)<br />A strong desire to make some changes ("Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face") in spite of the current unfulfilling situation ("Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself"). This, masked as an extremely catchy rock tune.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/129kuDCQtHs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>06. Yo La Tengo - Mushroom cloud of Hiss (1992)<br />A distortion-driven guitar trip accompanied by tireless drums and bass (with a great early energy release at 3:10 and crazy comeback at 8:13, after 2 minutes of mad distortion). Pure rock n' roll.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Mwe2ziqbgc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>05. Nick Drake - Way to Blue (1969)<br />Tragically beautiful, this track invites us to the author's world of agony and pain. Feels like twisting a knife inside a wound and not being able to scream or move.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkjb9sUgqUM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>04. Power Trip - Executioner's Tax (2017)<br />The archetype of a great metal song, with its impeccable guitar riff and vocals (and the lyrics one would expect - "Cry all you want, but the blade soars today"). Nothing to add, and nothing to take away.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdE4RO_P-qE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>03. Slowdive - No Longer Making Time (2017)<br />Instantly nostalgic, this song quickly reaches its emotional peak at 1:15. Feels like driving on a highway, but in space. Lyrics are one of those you can "adapt"/"bend" to whatever you want them to be.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMSAELTTgrk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>02. Sectioned - Beautiful Struggle (2018)<br />A brutal and ferocious musical representation of the "beautiful struggle", both musically (with incredible emotional zenith around ~1:08) and lyrically ("The pointless struggle / Against yourself / Who are you? / Who am I even talking to? / Find yourself at the bottom of a bottle / [...] / This is revenge unto myself"). Can't tell whether this is an invite to self-destruction or rather a desperate cry for redemption? Could be both.</p>

    <p>  01. Fishmens - Long Season (5/5) (1996)<br />The steady and groovy drums and bass, the hypnotic piano, the dreamy guitar, the care-free singing, and the surprising accordion all work together perfectly to deliver what was my best musical trip of the year. Felt totally lost. (Full album for whole experience).</p>
