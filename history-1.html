    <h1>History (Prehistory ‚Üí ~600BCE)</h1>

    <p><a href="/">Back</a></p>

    <p>In the last few weeks I‚Äôve been busy with the first part of my 2023 project of refreshing my knowledge of <b>history</b>. The resources I‚Äôm using are the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-World-Christopher-Lascelles/dp/1909979228">Christopher Lascelles - A Short History of the World</a> (dry facts)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-History-World-Histories/dp/030014332X">E. H. Gombrich - A Little History of the World</a> (storytelling, Polish translation)</li>
      <li><i>Storia</i> section of the <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Manuale-cultura-generale-Roberto-Albanesi/dp/8848138144)">Manuale di Cultura Generale</a> (dry facts)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.pl/Timeline-World-History-Matt-Baker/dp/1645174174">Matt Baker, John Andrews - Timeline of World History</a> (both the book and the incredibly useful chart)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This first part includes the time from prehistory to c. 600 BCE (just before the Achaemenid Empire). Apart from books, I‚Äôve also watched an overwhelming 10+ hours (üòÖ) of shorter and longer videos. Here is a selection of them:</p>

    <p><b>Early humans / Palaeolithic / Neolithic</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>I can recommend this channel: <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/@StefanMilo/videos">Stefan Milo</a>. I also watched a very good documentary about the Neanderthal species and its encounter with the Cro-Magnons in South-West France, circa 35,000 BCE. It was in Italian and, unfortunately, the only version I found in English on the web is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhvbvN6vOJs">this</a>, in 360p :|), but there are many other interesting videos on the previously-mentioned channel, too.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyncgjpSNlQ">Rewolucja neolityczna</a> (Polish). There are many English videos too, but I haven‚Äôt watched them. This trilogy seems very interesting though, if you‚Äôve got the time. Part 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-bQx0ZtHUw">The Birth of Civilisation - The First Farmers (20000 BC to 8800 BC)</a></li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Mesopotamia</b>: from Uruk, Sumerians and Akkadians, to Babylonians and Assyrians, with the culmination of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (this last one way into the Iron Age). These three videos provide a short summary and context for this region, spanning almost three millennia, just before the Fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire in 539 BCE.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZedmncHt3OQ">Ancient Mesopotamia Explained: Sumerians, Assyrians, Persians and Babylonians</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXTCbVLeOnE">The History of Ancient Mesopotamia in 15 Minutes</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oys6EQtpCJk">The Ancient Middle East: Every Year</a></li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Egypt</b>: My favorite video summarising this civilisation was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcocpnz3qu8">Antico Egitto in (quasi) 20 minuti</a>, in Italian, but you can try to translate it via Youtube. Otherwise it‚Äôs not difficult to find an English version.</p>


    <p>For <b>more civilisations</b> take a look at these YT channels: <i>Captivating History</i>, <i>History with Cy</i>, <i>Epimetheus</i>, <i>King and Generals</i>, <i>Fall of Civilisations</i>.

      Here are a few more links covering a myriad of lesser known civilisations from the Bronze and Iron Age: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKGq56YP98I">Indus Valley Civilisation</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RrAoL_PVmo">Early Chinese Civilisations</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTqgksmmAuY">Olmecs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sttutf4P_BY">Hittites</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8io674-QMA">Minoans</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8io674-QMA">Mycenaeans</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvzXRtAe0Mw">Phoenicians</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZybFYikBMLg">Israel and Judah</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Bonus</b>: A friend of mine recommended to me this channel (Fall of Civilisations) and I found this video to be quite intriguing, as the Bronze Age Collapse was the topic that fascinated me the most during this research. Changes in climate, the widespread use of iron, the mysterious ‚ÄúSea People‚Äù, the interconnection of trade between established empires (New Kingdom of Egypt, Hittites, Mycenaeans) and their subsequent decline (or even downright fall)... all of this is majestically explained here: <br/> <br/>
